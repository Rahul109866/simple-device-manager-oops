# simple-device-manager-oops
Device Manager & Monitor Simulation

This Python script models a basic device management system with a focus on monitors. It defines a DeviceManager class for managing connected devices and a Device class as a base class for various devices. Additionally, a Monitor subclass inherits from Device and introduces monitor-specific features like display modes and refresh rate settings. The script provides a simulation of device connection, disconnection, and interaction.

Key Features:
- DeviceManager class for managing connected devices.
- Device and Monitor classes to represent various devices.
- Monitor class introduces display modes and refresh rate settings.
- Simulation of device connection, disconnection, and property updates.

Note: This code is intended for educational purposes and provides a foundation for understanding object-oriented programming concepts.
